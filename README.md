# Human-Value-Detection
The following project invloves developing NLP system which can detect human values present in the text. Human values include self enhancement, self direction, openess to change etc. To achieve this task many ML algorithms including SVM, hierarchical classification model and decision trees were used. Language models like BERT and RoBERTa were also employed, with RoBERTa yielding the best results. Mistral 7-B has also been fine-tuned for the above task.
